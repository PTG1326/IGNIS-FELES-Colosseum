# [IGNIS FELES]

A fast-paced, 2D top-down roguelike shooter where you are the only light in an endless, dark world. Fight off hordes of enemies, collect gold, and grab powerful upgrades to survive as long as you can.

## üìñ About The Game

You are a lone light in the encroaching darkness. This is a top-down, arcade-style shooter where your survival depends on your skill and your light.

Your visibility is limited to a "candlelight" field of view centered on your character. Enemies (melee, ranged, and ground-stomping variants) will emerge from the shadows to attack you. As you defeat enemies, your score increases. At key score milestones (250, 500, 750), your light **"Burns Brighter,"** permanently expanding your FOV and helping you see what's coming.

Defeated enemies explode into a shower of gold coins that you can collect to build your score. Manage your weapon's **overheat bar**‚Äîfiring too rapidly will disable your weapon, forcing a dangerous cooldown.

Look for rare, temporary upgrades dropped by enemies to turn the tide:
* **Multi-Shot:** Fire three bullets in a spread.
* **Speed Boost:** Doubles your max speed and acceleration.
* **Coin Vacuum:** Massively increases your coin collection radius.

Survive, upgrade, and get the highest score possible before you are overwhelmed.

## üåê‚õìÔ∏è Solana Integration

Each player can connect their devnet account and have a personal score account (which stores the maximum score the player has ever got) which is made on the chain and then will be used to create the global leaderboard.

Future Prospects
- Incrementally storing a json of game state on the chain to ensure fairness while maintaining performance
- Creating a bigger leaderboard data account on chain so that the leaderboard is also secure (currently on web2)
- larger maps , more enemies, more upgrades and even more funnnnnn
