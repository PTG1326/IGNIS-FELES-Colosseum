Of course. Using stairs to create different elevations is a fantastic idea; it adds verticality and makes the world feel much more dynamic and complex.

Here are four distinct regions you can build on your large map, combining your props with the use of stairs.

### ## 1. The Sunken Graveyard

* **Concept:** A low-lying, somber area that the player must descend into. The lower elevation can create a slightly misty or spooky atmosphere, making it feel separate from the rest of the world.
* **Use of Stairs:** A single, wide flight of stone stairs leads down from the main ground level into this basin. You can flank the top of the stairs with `Rune Pillars` or large `Stone 07` rocks.
* **Key Props:** `Gravestone 01-03`, `Well 01` (as a central feature), `Wooden Gate 01 Opened` (as broken fencing), `Bush 02` and `Bush 04` (as sparse, dead-looking foliage).

### ## 2. The Citadel Highlands

* **Concept:** The opposite of the graveyardâ€”a raised plateau that was once a place of importance. This is the highest point on your map, offering a clear view. It should feel ancient and powerful.
* **Use of Stairs:** Long, winding stairs cut into the side of a cliff lead up to this elevated area.
* **Key Props:** `Altar 01` as the central focal point, `Rune Pillar X2` and `Rune Pillar Broken` as markers of its past glory, `Stone Bench` for contemplation, and `Stone Lantern 01`. The `Plant - Altar 01` prop can be used to show nature reclaiming the space.

### ## 3. The Tangled Woods & Campsite

* **Concept:** The main "ground level" biome that connects all other regions. It's a dense, natural forest with winding paths. Within this forest, you can create a small clearing that serves as an abandoned campsite.
* **Use of Stairs:** This area generally won't use stairs, but small, broken wooden steps could lead over a small hill or stream bed to add minor verticality.
* **Key Props:**
    * **Forest:** `Tree 01/02/03` and all the `Bush` props to create density. Use `Stone 01-07` to break up the paths.
    * **Campsite:** `Road Sign 01`, `Chest 01 Open`, `Crate 01/02`, and `Barrel 01`. Scatter some broken `Pots` around to complete the scene.

### ## 4. The Quarry Ravine

* **Concept:** A man-made, excavated area with multiple small levels and dead ends. This zone is perfect for creating interesting combat encounters with lots of cover.
* **Use of Stairs:** Short, functional flights of stairs connect the different tiers of the quarry. This area would have the most complex navigation.
* **Key Props:** Use the `Stone Cube 01` and `Brick 01-03` props heavily to create the look of excavated and processed stone. Scatter `Crates` and `Barrels` as if they were left behind by workers. The `Well 01` could also fit here as a water source for the old operation.

By connecting these varied zones, your single large map will feel like a journey through a world with a real history and diverse geography. Spawning in the Sunken Graveyard will feel completely different from spawning in the Citadel Highlands, giving you the replayability you're looking for.



Here are some "scenes" you can build with this set:

The Lonely Grave: A single tombstone or cross partially overgrown with bushes. Maybe a single broken pot next to it. Story: Someone was buried here, alone and forgotten.

The Ritual Site: Use the circular well or the large cross tomb as a centerpiece. Surround it with the glowing runestones. Story: This was a place of power or magic. The glow will be a huge lure for the player.

The Traveler's Rest: A stone bench facing a statue. Place it along what looks like a (now-vanished) path. Story: This was once a peaceful place for contemplation.

The Smuggler's Stash: This is your "loot" surprise. Behind a dense cluster of trees, place a chest, a few crates, and a barrel. Story: Someone hid their goods here. This is an immediate, tangible reward.

The Cemetery: A cluster of 3-5 different graves and tombstones, perhaps "walled in" by the wall_bottom tile. This feels like a major discovery.
